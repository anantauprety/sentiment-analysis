# sentiment-analysis
Learning to do sentiment analysis on some twitter data. Basically, I am trying to classify whether some tweets have positive or negative sentiment. I am using scikit-learn and pybrain to play around with already labelled data. Using various machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Neural Networks, KNN, Boosting and SVM to see which would be the best method to classify the given data. 

Many thanks to http://thinknook.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-training-corpus-dataset-2012-09-22/ where I was able to download hand labeled data.
